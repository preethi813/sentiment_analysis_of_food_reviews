Sentiment analysis is the automated process of understanding the sentiment or opinion of a given text. You can use it to automatically analyze product reviews and sort them by Positive, Neutral, Negative.
How is sentiment analysis on reviews done?
Repustate’s product review sentiment analysis API is used to find insights and relationships within your textual data. Our three-step process is simple:

1. Data Gathering:

Gather and prepare your data that you want to analyze whether it’s internal (customer feedback) or external data (reviews from rating sites). To prepare the data for text analysis, all you need to do is put it into a CSV or XLS document format.

2. Apply Review Sentiment Analysis API:

Run your input data through your sentiment analytics API. It will quickly return sentiment scores for each relevant review topic, aspect, or entity ranging from -1 for negative emotions, 0 for neutral feelings, and 1 for positive sentiment.

3. Sentiment Analysis Dashboard:

Once you receive the sentiment scoring, you can use various different data visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Repustate’s Sentiment analysis dashboard to quickly turn your data into visual reports. These reports are made up of charts, graphs and tables to discover trends, patterns, and actionable insights in your data.

An aspect is a particular part or feature of business, for example, customer service, that topics can be classified under. But customer service can be broken out into various topics such as wait staff, line ups, reservations, etc. A topic or subject is the matter or subject dealt with in the review. For example, pizza is a topic that can be classified under the aspect of food. Topics are more granular or specific than aspects, and therefore the sentiments expressed about pizza are more actionable than if it was only classified as food. Entities are people, places and things such as business people, competitors, locations, etc.

Sentiment analysis for reviews, uses named entity recognition to breakout all your insights and categorize them in a way that is easy and quick. So you can put your focus on improving your business with the help of your customer feedback.
